# Overview

**Bianca** is a Visual Novel (VN) engine baked directly into a Discord message.

It uses a rudimentary `.dvn` script to generate the game and outputs a frame,
the character's name and dialogue, and action buttons for saving, loading,
and choice-making.

This documentation will cover each of the features in a concise manner
and provide examples. It assumes you're familiar with some basic programming
concepts already, but the syntax is likely intuitive enough for a beginner
to figure it out by playing around.

If you want to see some working sample scripts, you may find them under the
"Samples" topic.
